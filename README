Summary
-------
Maven archetype providing a pre-configured and basic Spring Batch setup. This setup provides the most common starting point I have seen which is reading from a flat file and writing to a database.

NOTE: If you would prefer a pre-built version of the generated output, for the most part this functionality has been merged into the Spring Batch project as of 2.2.0 and can be found in the "archetypes/simple-cli" directory. While its not a full archetype, it provides similar capabilities and the ability to copy/paste the code as is.

Features
--------
Some features that work out of the box are:

* Basic reader, processor and writer example.
* Uses hsqldb as an in memory data source.
* Ability to run via maven or a deployment package.
* Example test coverage.


Local Install
-------------
clone the archetype
cd maven-springbatch-archetype (or your custom clone directory)
mvn install


Use
---
cd ~/work (or wherever you want to build to)

mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.dtzq \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-springbatch-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.2 \
  -DgroupId=your_group_id \
  -DartifactId=the_artifact_id \
  -Dpackage=the_package_name \
  -Dversion=the_version \
  -DjobName=the_job_name

Answer any questions and the build will end up in a directory named after your artifact ID.

cd $artifactId ; mvn package

At this point you can run the job two ways out of the box:

1. Maven assembled package.
   * After running "mvn package" a file with the naming convention of "the_artifact_id-the_version-distribution.tar.gz" will be located in the target/ directory of the project. Extract this archive where you want to run the batch job and invoke via the ./bin/runJob.sh script. You may need to make this script executable.
   * This work based off Lucas Ward's blog post, located at:
     * http://www.lucasward.net/2010/07/spring-batch-deployment-example.html

2. Maven exec
   * Run: mvn exec:java
   * See the exec-maven-plugin section of the pom for more info on setting the job bean config file and job name.

Summary
-------
Maven archetype providing a pre-configured and basic Spring Batch setup. Mainly based off the STS Spring Batch project
template with some formatting, structure etc changes. I wanted something I could generate a quick skeleton project from
to reproduce issues, try out new features, and so on.

Features
--------
Some features that work out of the box are:

* Basic reader and writer example.
* Uses hsqldb as an in memory data source.


Local Install
-------------
cd maven-springbatch-archetype
mvn clean compile package install


Use
---
cd ~/work (or wherever you want to build to)

mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.dtzq \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-springbatch-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=your_group_id \
  -DartifactId=the_artifact_id \
  -Dpackage=the_package_name \
  -Dversion=the_version

Answer the questions and the build will end up in a directory named after your artifact ID.

cd $artifactId ; mvn clean compile package

At this point you can either run the resulting jar in the target/ directory passing the job bean config and job name
along with providing the required libraries on the classpath or run via maven using the command:

mvn exec:java

See the exec-maven-plugin section of the pom for more info on setting the job bean config file and job name.
